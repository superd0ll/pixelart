# Pixel Art Maker
##  A one-page web application
The task is to create a one-page web application that lets users draw a pixel image on a customizable panel.

The starter code, is given (it is including HTML and CSS) to start building the application. The JavaScript code lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

>Users are able to:
- Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
- Choose a color.
- Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.

The primary task in this project is the implementation of the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.
